Hello everyone,  
  
I'm @jazlynnhall, a Columbia PhD student interested in identifying relationships between vegetation, extreme climate events, and water resource provision in Puerto Rico. I utilize geospatial techniques, remote sensing, and field estimates to study the effects of droughts and hurricanes on forests and the subsequent impact on ecosystem services.  
  
This page is my attempt to bumble through scientific methods, principles, and results through various models and maps.  
 
Enjoy!
